# Styles for perspective-daily.de

## concise_startpage.user.css

Changes to the start page

* reduce header height and several spacings
* make article cards wider, i.e. less linebreaks in abstracts
* reduce height of article images

For my screen setup this yields two article cards visible at the same time instead of one. Plus generally less scrolling
in the list of articles.

## articlepage.user.css

Changes to the article pages

* reduce header height
* make article text wider
* automatically expand sidenode text

For my screen setup this means less scrolling. And by expanding the sidenotes - which are also links - I can directly
see what they are about. Plus I can use middle-mouse-click to open the link in a new background tab if I want to.
