# Styles for perspective-daily.de

## concise_startpage.user.css

Changes to the start page

* reduce header height and several spacings
* make article cards wider, i.e. less linebreaks in abstracts
* reduce height of article images

For my screen setup this yields two article cards visible at the same time instead of one. Plus generally less scrolling
in the list of articles.
