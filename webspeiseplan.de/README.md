# Styles for webspeiseplan.de

## menu.user.css

Changes to the menu page

-   do not display header image
-   for each dish
    -   do not display image
    -   do not display the click area to open the details view

For my screen setup and canteen this will make all dishes of one day fit the page without scrolling.

Using the URL regex this should also work for different canteens.
